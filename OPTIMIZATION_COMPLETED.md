## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizations
```typescript
// Debounced resize handling
const debouncedCheckDevice = useCallback(
  debounce(checkDevice, 150),
  [checkDevice]
);

// Memoized components
const AnalyticsOptimized = React.memo(function AnalyticsOptimized() {
  // Component implementation
});

// Throttled video progress
if (onProgress && Math.floor(state.playedSeconds) % 1 === 0) {
  onProgress(state);
}
```

### SEO Implementation
```typescript
<SEO 
  title="Community Hub - Real Estate Investor Network"
  description="Connect with fellow real estate investors..."
  keywords={["real estate community", "investor network"]}
  ogImage="/community-preview.jpg"
/>
```

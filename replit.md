# G.R.E.W. - Global Real Estate Wholesaling Platform

## Overview
G.R.E.W. (Global Real Estate Wholesaling) is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) designed to teach real estate wholesaling methodologies worldwide. The platform spreads the proven concept of US real estate wholesaling to international markets, teaching strategies for making money from real estate with no money out of pocket, no experience, and no licenses required, from anywhere in the world. It focuses on simplified LMS functionality adapted for global application, designed for users of all ages and technical proficiencies across different countries and markets.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design preference: Professional, simple, and clear-cut design - moving away from social media aesthetic to business-focused interface.
Accessibility focus: Platform should be easy enough for older and less tech-savvy people to use, with simplified design and clear navigation.
Efficiency Preferences:
- User expressed concern about paying repeatedly for issues that should be caught on first attempt
- Needs proactive error detection and comprehensive solutions rather than iterative fixes
- Prefers complete implementations over partial solutions requiring follow-up work
- Requires permanent fixes that don't regress after restarts/refreshes
